# This app is made for the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, Region III.

This app is also rewritten with more advanced knowledge. This project should be finished at around February 28* for rewriting.

I'm sorry for the reset of progress. I'm trying to balance two projects including this one, my OJT period, and my rapidly declining mental health.

I'm thankful for my girlfriend for supporting me in every way possible!

# UPDATE #1

I decided to settle down with the old version of the app. Though this new version would be uploaded soon, maybe after a few months when I get the burst of motivation again.

My mental health is at an all-time low whilst I have two more projects I have working on alongside this.

One of those projects is paid, whilst the other one is connected to my studies, so I decided to put this in the backburner since this has the least priority on my standards.
