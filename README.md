I'm sorry for the reset of progress. I'm trying to balance two projects including this one, my OJT period, and my rapidly declining mental health.
I'm thankful for my girlfriend, and my family for supporting me in every way possible!

## A little information about the site itself...
This project is already live riiiight [here](https://bjmpro3pos.com, 'BJMP POS Site') complete with backend code. But it has a bit of bugs and defects in it since this project was worked on solo, was worked on for a Capstone project, and is currently using the old structuring for the code.

This app has the following features if compiled with the backend:
1. A prisoner recording system complete with a simple e-Wallet.
2. A dashboard page to view all data in the system (A bit wonky on handling data)
3. A stock and inventory management system.
4. A point-of-sales system that currently accepts on biometrics using [Secugen API and Readers](https://secugen.com, 'SecuGen')
5. A loading system that tops up e-Wallets.

The backend code runs on PHP and uses phpMyAdmin for the database management. The third-party dependencies used for the backend are [TCPDF](https://tcpdf.org) and [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer). I'll upload the backend code sooner but it is a lot messy than the frontend code.

### UPDATE #1
I decided to settle down with the [old version](https://github.com/shinomikko8888/bjmpposimswebapp, "The old version of the frontend code, this version isn't commited to the latest as of writing") of the app. Though this new version would be uploaded soon, maybe after a few months when I get the burst of motivation again.
My mental health is at an all-time low whilst I have two more major projects I have working on alongside this one with a few minor projects that I want to revive soon.
One project is [paid](https://github.com/Navilicious/BAFI, "BAFI by Navilicious and me, private repo"), whilst the other one is connected to my [studies](https://saasconsole.com, "SaaSConsole from Hooli Software, Internship"), so I decided to put this in the backburner since this has the least priority on my standards.

If you want to ask me for a collab to help me finish this project. Hit me up on my Discord: shinomikko.

But I don't think you would benefit either way from helping me with this project.

I'll release another update soon when I finish. Till then, sayonara!

### UPDATE #2
So hi! I worked on this for quite a while since that burst of energy just hit me a few weeks ago. I really enjoyed working on this project now due to the things that I've learned from my experiences at my OJT. I'm applying most of the things I've learned here. 

Anyways, that's all for now.
